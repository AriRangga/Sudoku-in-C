# Sudoku in C  

An interactive **Sudoku Game** written in C from my programming basics final project that generates playable Sudoku puzzles and allows players to solve them with helpful features like input validation, hints, and a timer. This project demonstrates fundamental concepts in C programming such as recursion, 2D arrays, and logical problem-solving while delivering an engaging user experience.

## üìñ How to Play  
1. **Start the Game**  
   - Choose a difficulty level:  
     - `1` for Easy  
     - `2` for Medium  
     - `3` for Hard  
2. **Understand the Board**  
   - The board is displayed with numbers and empty cells represented as `.`.  
   - Original numbers are fixed, and new numbers can be added.  

3. **Input Your Move**  
   - Enter your move in this format:  
     ```
     <row> <column> <number>
     ```  
     Example:  
     ```
     3 4 7
     ```  
     - `row`: Row number (1‚Äì9).  
     - `column`: Column number (1‚Äì9).  
     - `number`: Value to place (1‚Äì9).  

4. **Use Special Commands**  
   - `hint`: Get a suggestion for an empty cell.  
   - `reset`: Reset the puzzle to its starting state.  
   - `keluar`: Exit the game.  

5. **Win the Game**  
   - Fill all cells correctly to complete the puzzle.  
   - The program validates your solution and displays your total time.
